# NYC PyLadies Study Group

Sign up on Meetup [HERE](https://www.meetup.com/NYC-PyLadies/) 

### Description.

On the second Monday of every month [Galvanize New York](https://www.galvanize.com/new-york/campus) will host an NYC PyLadies study group; a regular gathering for PyLadies of all levels to work on solo projects or in collaboration with one another. It will be a welcoming space where any Python related question is fair game, beginner or advanced, or in-between.

Our goal is to foster a community where attendees can share coding tips, cool python finds, or short tutorials, set realistic goals, and encourage one another. We canâ€™t wait to build a stronger PyLadies community in New York City!
